    <p style="padding: 5px 20px 0 20px;">The essence of lucid dreaming or out-of-body experience is 
        that practitioners suddenly realize that they are asleep and that the reality around them is 
        their dream. These phenomena have lost their mystical halo and are now regarded as science 
        and it is accessible to almost everyone. There are special ancient and modern techniques that 
        help one to achieve lucid dreaming. You can use it to get information from the subconscious, 
        influence physiology, entertainment, meetings with other people, travel to any corner of the 
        universe and time. You can find yourself in a reality in which the usual laws of physics and 
        logic do not work, where your possibilities become almost limitless. But in fact you cannot 
        fully control what happens in a lucid dream, just as you cannot fully control all the processes 
        in your body.</p>
