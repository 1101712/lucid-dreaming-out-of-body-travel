    <p>The essence of lucid dreaming or out-of-body experience is that practitioners realize that they are outside
        their
        physical body. These phenomena lost their mystical halo and now are regarded by sience as a single
        phenomenon: the phase
        state. It
        is accessible to everyone. You even can use it for obtain information sub-consciousness and influence the
        physiology. They find themselves in a reality in which the usual laws of physics and logic do not work. Their
        possibilities become
        limitless.</p>
