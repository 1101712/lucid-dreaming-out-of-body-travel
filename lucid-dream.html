            <p>More often than not, it happens like this – everything in your dream is as normal,  
                nothing special, but suddenly you 
                realize that this is a dream. You don't immediately believe it, because the world around you is no
                 different from reality. Well, unless you show perseverance and start using special reality check 
                 techniques. But even they don't always work – the reality of a dream is so much like ordinary 
                 reality. Another option is when the practitioner consciously tries to get into a lucid dream or 
                 what is called "an exit from the body". Very often, but not always, the moment of transition is 
                 accompanied by strange sound or tactile effects. The practitioner may feel that a jet plane has 
                 flown next to him, that he is being sucked into a funnel or he is falling from a great height. 
                 If you don't get scared and continue practicing, then what is called separation will happen. 
                 It can be slow, like the gradual crawling of a butterfly from a chrysalis. It can be 
                 instantaneous, and the practitioner suddenly finds himself looking at himself/herself 
                 sleeping in bed or abruptly finds himself on the floor or in the middle of the room in 
                 which he fell asleep. In fact, all this is the same phenomenon, a special state of the 
                 brain, which has long been studied by scientists. This is the so-called "Phase".
